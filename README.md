## Game Engine

 This game was developed using Unity 2022.3.13f1

## Game Development

 For my third project using Unity, I decided to focus on ironing out the planning phase. Development began with a bunch of ideas. I outlined each level, its special features and player powers, then created an initial sketch of the first level in MS Paint. The sketch was freehand and wasn't exactly... drawn in perspective properly... but really helped visualize the level.

 Working with 3D models was a fun shift in pace. I mostly used prefabs from the Unity Asset Store, combining a few different packs to suit the various environments in the level. I also spent more time in sound design, playing different sounds based on the surface the ball was touching, and adjusting amplitude by its velocity. The timeframe for the project only allowed for the first level to be made, but I'm planning to revisit this project in the future :) 

## Challenges and Learnings

 This project was definitely the most fun I've had in Unity. Literally every part of this game was from scratch, except the assets, but even for those, I made custom prefabs for fencing, walls, and more. The hardest challenge with this project was getting the platform to stay frozen on the yaw axis. I spent way too long trying to figure out why the platform was slowly rotating while moving it around.

## How to Play

To play "Droppin' Tilted," follow these simple steps:

1. Download the latest release from the repository's [Releases](#) page.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.

Enjoy your exquisite puzzle-solving adventure, and may it be as enjoyable to play as it was to create :)
